// Сounts the number of unique viewers of a video entity over CDN. It doesn't

//
// All unique viewers for the specified period of time are counted.
//
// **How does it work?**
//
// Calculating the number of unique viewers for a Live stream or VOD over CDN
// involves aggregating and analyzing various metrics to ensure each individual
// viewer is counted only once, regardless of how many times they connect or
// disconnect during the stream.
//
// This method provides statistics for any video viewing by unique users,
// regardless of viewing method and a player you used. Thus, this is the most
// important difference from viewing through the built-in player:
//
// - In method /statistics/uniqs viewers of the built-in player are tracked only.
// - But this method tracks all viewers from everywhere.
//
// This method is a combination of two other Live and VOD detailed methods. If you
// need detailed information, then see the methods: `/statistics/stream/viewers`
// and `/statistics/vod/viewers`.
//
// **Data Processing and Deduplication**
//
// We us IP Address & User-Agent combination. Each unique combination of IP address
// and User-Agent string might be considered a unique viewer.
//
// This approach allows to accurately estimate the number of unique viewers.
// However, this is not foolproof due to NAT (Network Address Translation) and
// shared networks. Thus if your users fall under such restrictions, then the
// number of unique viewers may be higher than calculated.
//
// **Why is there no "Unique Views" method?**
//
// Based on CDN data, we can calculate the number of unique viewers only. Thus only
// your player will be able to count the number of unique views (clicks on the Play
// button) within the player session (i.e. how many times 1 unique viewer clicked
// the Play button within a unique player's session).
