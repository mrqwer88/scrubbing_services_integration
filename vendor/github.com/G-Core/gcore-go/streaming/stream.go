// The input in API may contain streams of different formats, including the most
// common ones RTMP, RTMPS, SRT, HLS. Note that multicast MPEG-TS over UDP and
// others are supported too, ask the Support Team please.
//
// For ingestion, you can use both PUSH and PULL methods.
//
// Also you can use the main and backup servers, which are geographically located
// in different locations. By default, any free ingest points in the world are
// used. Settings have been applied that deliver low-latency streams in the optimal
// way. If for some reason you need to set a fixed ingest point, or if you need to
// set the main and backup ingest points in the same region (for example, do not
// send streams outside the EU or US), then contact our Support Team.
//
// The output is HLS and MPEG-DASH with ABR. We transcode video for you by our
// cloud-based infrastructure. ABR ladder supports all qualities from SD to 8K HDR
// 60fps.
//
// All our streams are Low Latency enabled. We support a delay of ±4 seconds for
// video streams by utilizing Common Media Application Format (CMAF) technology. So
// you obtain latency from the traditional 30-50 seconds to ±4 seconds only by
// default. If you need legacy non-low-latency HLS, then look at HLS MPEG-TS
// delivery below.
//
// You have access to additional functions such as:
//
// - DVR
// - Recording
// - Live clipping
// - Restreaming
// - (soon) AI Automatic Speech Recognition for subtitles/captions generating
//
// For more information see specific API methods, and the Knowledge Base.

// Returns the complete details of a specific live stream, including its current

//
// Current State You can determine the real-time status of your broadcast using
// these fields:
//
// - `active`: Whether the stream is enabled in your account.
// - `live`: `true` if the primary ingest point is receiving a signal.
// - Backup fields like `backup_live` show if the redundant ingest is active.
//
// Ingestion URLs The response includes URLs for various ingestion protocols to
// start your broadcast:
//
// - **RTMP/RTMPS**: `push_url` and `backup_push_url`.
// - **SRT**: `push_url_srt` and `backup_push_url_srt`.
// - **WebRTC (WHIP)**: `push_url_whip`.
//
// Playback URLs & Low Latency The platform provides several Adaptive Bitrate (ABR)
// playback options. Modern delivery utilizes Common Media Application Format
// (CMAF) to achieve Low Latency (±4 seconds):
//
//   - **LL-HLS (HLS CMAF)**: `hls_cmaf_url`. Recommended for most modern players to
//     get aka Low Latency (LL-HLS).
//   - **LL-DASH (MPEG-DASH CMAF)**: `dash_url`. Optimized for web and Android to get
//     aka Low Latency (LL-DASH).
//   - **Legacy HLS (MPEG-TS)**: `hls_mpegts_url`.
//
// **Choosing the right link:** Low Latency technology (CMAF) provides the best
// low-latency experience but requires a stable internet connection. Use the
// **MPEG-TS** URL for outdated legacy devices or in cases where the viewer's
// internet connection is unstable and they see buffering, as this format is more
// resilient.

// Start recording a stream.
//
// Stream will be recorded and automatically saved in our video hosting as a
// separate video VOD:
//
//   - ID of the stream from which the recording was organized is added to
//     "stream_id" field. You can find the video by that value later.
//   - Title of the video is based on pattern "Stream Record: {`stream_title`},
//     {`recording_end_time_utc`}".
//   - Recording start time is stored in "recording_started_at" field.
//   - You can record the original stream or the transcoded one. Only the transcoded
//     version will contain overlays. Set the appropriate recording method when
//     creating the stream or before calling this recording method. Details in the
//     "record_type" parameter of the stream.
//   - If you have access to the premium feature of saving the original stream (so
//     not just transcoded renditions), then the link to the original file will be in
//     the "origin_url" field. The original file is stored for up to 7 days and is
//     then deleted automatically. By default, custom retention for original recorded
//     files is not available. For enterprise customers, this retention policy can be
//     adjusted individually upon request. Look at the description of the field how
//     to use it.
//
// Stream must be live for the recording to start, please check fields "live"
// and/or "backup_live". After the recording starts, field "recording" will switch
// to "true", and the recording duration in seconds will appear in the
// "recording_duration" field.
//
// Please, keep in mind that recording doesn't start instantly, it takes ±3-7
// seconds to initialize the process after executing this method.
//
// Stream recording stops when:
//
//   - Explicit execution of the method /`stop_recording`. In this case, the file
//     will be completely saved and closed. When you execute the stream recording
//     method again, the recording will be made to a new video file.
//
//   - When sending the stream stops on the client side, or stops accidentally. In
//     this case, recording process is waiting for 10 seconds to resume recording:
//
//   - If the stream resumes within that period, recording will continue to the same
//     file.
//
//   - After that period, the file will be completely saved and closed.
//
//   - If the stream suddenly resumes after this period, the recording will go to a
//     new file, because old file is closed already. Please, also note that if you
//     have long broadcasts, the recording will be cut into 4-hour videos. This value
//     is fixed, but can be changed upon request to the Support Team.

	// You can use this legacy HLSv6 format based on MPEG-TS segmenter in parallel with
	// main HLS CMAF. Both formats are sharing same segments size, manifest length
	// (DVR), etc.
	//
	// It is also possible to use additional modifier-attributes:
	//
	//   - ?`get_duration_sec`=true – Adds the real segment duration in seconds to chunk
	//     requests. A chunk duration will be automatically added to a chunk request
	//     string with the "duration_sec" attribute. The value is an integer for a length
	//     multiple of whole seconds, or a fractional number separated by a dot for
	//     chunks that are not multiples of seconds. This attribute allows you to
	//     determine duration in seconds at the level of analyzing the logs of CDN
	//     requests and compare it with file size (so to use it in your analytics).
	//
	// Such modifier attributes are applied manually and added to the link obtained
	// from this field. I.e. `<hls_url>?get_duration_sec=true`
	//
	// Example:

	//   - false – stream is received by PUSH method. Use this when need to send stream
	//     from end-device to our Streaming Platform, i.e. from your encoder, mobile app
	//     or OBS Studio.
	Pull bool `json:"pull"`
	// URL to PUSH master stream to our main server using RTMP and RTMPS protocols.
	//
	// To use RTMPS just manually change the protocol name from "rtmp://" to
	// "rtmps://".
	//
	// Use only 1 protocol of sending a master stream: eitheronly RTMP/S (`push_url`),
	// or only SRT (`push_url_srt`).
	//
	// If you see an error like "invalid SSL certificate" try the following:
	//
	//   - Make sure the push URL is correct, and it contains "rtmps://".
	//   - If the URL looks correct but you still get an SSL error, try specifying the
	//     port 443 in the URL. Here’s an example:
	//     rtmps://vp-push.domain.com:443/in/stream?key.
	//   - If you're still having trouble, then your encoder may not support RTMPS.
	//     Double-check the documentation for your encoder.
	//
	// Please note that 1 connection and 1 protocol can be used at a single moment in
	// time per unique stream key input. Trying to send 2+ connection requests into the
	// single `push_url`, or 2+ protocols at once will not lead to a result.

	// SRT is designed as a low-latency transport protocol, but real networks are not
	// always stable and in some cases the end-to-end path from the venue to the ingest
	// point can be long. For this reason, it is important to configure the latency
	// parameter carefully to match the actual network conditions.
	//
	// Small latency values may lead to packet loss when jitter or retransmissions
	// occur, while larger values give SRT more time for retransmission and make
	// delivery more reliable at the cost of higher end-to-end delay. For streams sent
	// over the public internet, latency values of 2 seconds or more are a good
	// starting point.
	//
	// _Incorrect or low default value is one of the most common reasons for packet
	// loss, frames loss, and bad picture._
	//
	// We therefore recommend setting latency manually rather than relying on the
	// default, to ensure the buffer is correctly sized for your environment. Choose
	// the value based on RTT, jitter, expected packet loss, and acceptable delay. Read
	// more in the Product Documentation for exact values and use cases.
	//
	// Be sure to check and test SRT settings on your sender side. The default values
	// do not take into account your specific scenarios and do not work well. If
	// necessary, ask us and we will help you.
	//
	// **SRT passphrase encryption**
	//
	// `srt_passphrase` is accepted only for SRT PUSH ingest. If it is configured for
	// the stream, provide the same passphrase in your sender. The incoming SRT stream
	// is AES-encrypted between the sender and ingester.
	//
	// Please note that 1 connection and 1 protocol can be used at a single moment in
	// time per unique stream key input. Trying to send 2+ connection requests into the
	// single `push_url_srt`, or 2+ protocols at once will not lead to a result.
	//
	// For example, transcoding process will fail if:
	//
	//   - you are pushing primary and backup SRT to the same single `push_url_srt`
	//     simultaneously
	//   - you are pushing RTMP to `push_url` and SRT to `push_url_srt` simultaneously
	//
	// See more information and best practices about SRT protocol in the Product
	// Documentation.
	PushURLSrt string `json:"push_url_srt"`
	// URL to PUSH WebRTC stream to our server using WHIP protocol.
	//
	// **WebRTC WHIP to LL-HLS and DASH**
	//
	// Video Streaming supports WebRTC HTTP Ingest Protocol (WHIP), and WebRTC to
	// HLS/DASH converter. As a result you can stream from web broswers natively.
	//
	// **WebRTC WHIP server**
	//
	// We have dedicated WebRTC WHIP servers in our infrastructure. WebRTC WHIP server
	// organizes both signaling and receives video data. Signaling is a term to
	// describe communication between WebRTC endpoints, needed to initiate and maintain
	// a session. WHIP is an open specification for a simple signaling protocol for
	// starting WebRTC sessions in an outgoing direction, (i.e., streaming from your
	// device).
	//
	// There is the primary link only for WHIP, so no backup link.
	//
	// **WebRTC stream encoding parameters**
	//
	// At least one video and audio track both must be present in the stream:
	//
	// - Video must be encoded with H.264.
	// - Audio must be encoded with OPUS.
	//
	// Note. Specifically for WebRTC mode a method of constant transcoding with an
	// initial given resolution is used. This means that if WebRTC in the end-user's
	// browser decides to reduce the quality or resolution of the master stream (to let
	// say 360p) due to restrictions on the end-user's device (network conditions, CPU
	// consumption, etc.), the transcoder will still continue to transcode the reduced
	// stream to the initial resolution (let say 1080p ABR). When the restrictions on
	// the end-user's device are removed, quiality will improve again.
	//
	// **WebRTC WHIP Client**
	//
	// We provide a convenient WebRTC WHIP library for working in browsers. You can use
	// our library, or any other you prefer. Simple example of usage is here:
	// https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-j2r9ar?file=index.html

	// Please note that 1 connection and 1 protocol can be used at a single moment in
	// time per unique stream key input. Trying to send 2+ connection requests into the
	// single `push_url_whip`, or 2+ protocols at once will not lead to a result.
	//
	// For example, transcoding process will fail if:
	//
	//   - you are pushing primary and backup WHIP to the same single `push_url_whip`
	//     simultaneously
